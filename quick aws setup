# 🚀 AWS Deployment: Finalizing Your Setup

**Great news!** Your logs confirm the server is live and accessible.
The line `INFO: 110.235.229.210:38664 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` confirms your local machine is successfully communicating with the EC2 instance.

### ⚠️ Important: Use HTTP, not HTTPS

Because SSL certificates are not yet configured, the server only understands standard HTTP.

- **The Issue:** Browsers often force `https://`. This will cause an "Invalid HTTP request" error.
- **The Fix:** Manually ensure the URL starts with **http://**.
- **URL:** `http://75.101.175.60:8000`

### 🛠 1. Run Processes in the Background

To keep your servers running after you close the terminal, we will use `screen` sessions.

#### A. Deploy the Backend

1.  **Stop the current process:** Press `CTRL + C` in your terminal.
2.  **Create a backend session:**
    ```bash
    screen -S backend
    ```
3.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
4.  **Detach:** Press `CTRL + A`, then `D`.
    _(The backend is now running safely in the background.)_

#### B. Deploy the Frontend

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/trend-reversal-automation-bot/grid_automation_system
    ```
2.  **Build and serve:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    screen -S frontend
    npx serve -s dist -l 3000
    ```
3.  **Detach:** Press `CTRL + A`, then `D`.

### 🖥 2. Access Your Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:

👉 **[http://75.101.175.60:3000](http://75.101.175.60:3000)**

> **Note:** If the page fails to load, double-check that your browser hasn't automatically redirected you to `https`.

### ⚙️ 3. Maintenance Commands

Use these commands if you need to stop or restart your servers.

| Action                     | Command                      |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| **View running sessions**  | `screen -ls`                 |
| **Re-enter Backend logs**  | `screen -r backend`          |
| **Re-enter Frontend logs** | `screen -r frontend`         |
| **Stop Backend**           | `screen -X -S backend quit`  |
| **Stop Frontend**          | `screen -X -S frontend quit` |
| **Kill all sessions**      | `killall screen`             |
